# Personnal Blog

Here is a project that i made. as my main focus was learning about django's orm I used a [bootrap template](https://templatemag.com/demo/Kompleet/).  

## techno used

- django 3.1.5
- pillow
- Bootstrap 4 (html, css, scss, js)  

## What's cool about it

- everything is managed with a database
- there is user registration/authentification
- user page
- pleasant to see  

## What it looks like

here's some screenshots:
