# Personnal Blog

Here is a project that i made. as my main focus was learning about django's orm I used a [bootrap template](https://templatemag.com/demo/Kompleet/).  

## techno used

- django 3.1.5
- pillow
- Bootstrap 4 (html, css, scss, js) 
- crispy forms

## What's cool about it

- everything is managed with a database

### User system

- sign up/login/logout system
- every user have its own profile page
- every user can update their information on their profile page (profile picture too!)

### Posts

- every post have its own page
- every post can be deleted or updated by its author on the post page


## What it looks like

here's some screenshots:
